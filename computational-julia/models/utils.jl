Generate a random instance of the test allocation problem.
Returns two vectors of length n whose ith entries denote the
probability of being healthy and utility for the i-th

If `utils` [`probs`] is a vector or a range, entries are chosen uniformly at
random. Otherwise, it is a probability distribution, and entries are sampled
appropriately.

Utilities are rounded to the nearest integer.
